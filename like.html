	  <p>My first love is water, from pools to oceans, I love to be outdoors where
    I can enjoy being in the sun. I am currently learning how to swim, but I'm
    not afraid to go out alone. I am very idependent and determined. I love to
  enjoy myself with my cousins and others, but I have no problem making the best
of the moments when I'm alone. I also love animals. My favorite being a dog, but
I love all animals. My parents take me to the zoo and aquarium often. I love getting
to visit the animals, but since I can't take them home, I settle for stuffed animals.
